# Bailiwick

### The pro-User distributed social network.

No spyware.<br>
No surveillance.<br>
Own your data - you control who sees your stuff.<br>
Own your screen - you control who sends stuff to you.

## What makes Bailiwick different?
### Pull-oriented model
You only see comments and posts from the people you _subscribe_ to. No need to individually block brigading assholes - you'll never see them.

### Decentralized and pro-User
Humans are social animals. It's in our nature to want to talk to each other. Today, megacorporations are making billions of dollars hijacking 
our need for contact in order to sell our attention to advertising agencies. We aren't the Users of those systems - we're the product.

We also all walk around all day with supercomputers sitting idle in our pockets - let's put them to work for us!

### Responsibility vs Censorship
Posting things in Bailiwick is more akin to putting up content on a personal website. Your content belongs to you. 
Someone has to ask your permission in order to read it. OTOH, I'm not your Mom and I don't care what you do. 
Bailiwick is Decentralized - there's no one policing what you choose to share.

Every human group has social norms and rules. Centralized services try to enforce those norms through Terms of Service. It doesn't work very well.

Corporations have to hire armies of moderators to churn through the very worst the internet has to offer. Moderators typically burn out 
rapidly and end up with PTSD and other mental-health issues due to exposure to the dregs of our culture. It's one of the worst jobs in the world.

Part of the problem is that corporations have a responsibility under Section 203 to try to moderate the worst excesses (in exchange for being held
free of blame for the garbage their users post in the first place). It's an impossible situation. 

Also, the social norms of Twitter are not the same as those of Tumblr or Facebook or TikTok or Parler.

As a decentralized project, Bailiwick doesn't own your data - you do. But if you post something illegal, those consequences are yours as well.

There is no overarching censorship in Bailiwick - but there are filters. Posts may be tagged by anyone with access to a post. 
Other users with access to the post _and_ subscribed to the tagging user can filter the posts they view based on those tags. 
This is an attempt to balance a User's right to control what bits they view with a group's right to control its norms.

e.g. if Uncle Fragulous keeps accidentally crossposting girls-gone-inside-out to the family news group, anyone who has configured their 
client not to show posts tagged "nekkid", "nsfw", "boobs", etc - won't be surprised next time they're trying to find grammy's sweet potatoes. 

### Anonymity and Privacy
Bailiwick _actually_ respects your privacy and anonymity. It doesn't care who you are or what you post. You do you. 
Your posts are encrypted on your device. Only those you give the access keys to will be able to retrieve the data.

But be aware that Bailiwick is pseudonymous - _not_ fully anonymous.<br>
It doesn't know or care who _you_ are, but it does know your _device_. Your posts are tied to your account's encryption keys, which are tied to your particular
device. Bailiwick makes no effort to track you as a person - but if you do something that gets the attention of the FBI all they require is access to your phone 
to prove (more or less) that it was you who made a post.

### Great, so how does this work? 
Bailiwick is built on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS): The lookup table for who has which files is stored in chunks distributed across 
multiple nodes in the network. It's similar to the distributed technology that powers both BitTorrent and Bitcoin. When you access your friends' data
you'll also store and host a copy of their files, to make it easier for other folks looking for those files. OTOH, you won't store random files belonging
to folks you don't know. e.g. Your social networks will host copied files for each other, but you won't end up storing files for randos.

Your device is both a client and server in the IPFS network - you'll store your own data, posts from your friends and 
some "directory" chunks to aid in file lookup for other participants in the network - just as they will do the same for you!


### So how do I use it?
You can't. It's not done yet. Sorry. :(
